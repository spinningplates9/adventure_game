* Draw a 2D pixel art map using a tilemapping (very small btw) * 

*** Get character to move around the map *** IN PROGRESS

* Create interaction system when you click 'E' and a text box pulls up on NPCs and runs a if-condition check
    when the interaction is a pickupable item (might be a big feature)

* Develop a way to dynamically change health and currency values in the shop first
    so that the quests will be easier to pass and change values

* QUEST SYSTEM:
  - 2 Types of Quests 
    a. Battle
    b. Search and find
